This is a breakout board for the glass ferrule type fuse. It fits great with our [5mm fuse clips](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9773). Fuses are pretty simple, if current exceeds the rating of the fuse, the small filament inside the fuse heats up and breaks (like a light bulb burning out). The circuit is then broken and hopefully your circuit is saved from molten destruction.

For smaller loads, you may want to checkout a PTC (aka resettable fuse). They handle less current (500mA) but can be set and reset many times without doing harm to your system.


_Note: The PCB was designed for DC power. It was not designed for AC power. Make sure that you are using the fuse breakout on the DC side for protection!_
